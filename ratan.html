    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">ratan Tata is like a real-life superhero to me. He's not just a successful businessman; he's a kind and caring person who always thinks about others. He built amazing companies like Tata Motors and Tata Consultancy Services, but he also helped people in need, especially the poor and the sick. He's like a gentle giant, always calm and collected, even in tough times. I admire his humility and his belief in doing good. He's a true inspiration, showing us that you can be successful and kind at the same time.></p>
